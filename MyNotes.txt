SerDe:
Serialize on write
Deserialize on read
on write: The structured data is serialized into a bit / byte stream for storage.
on read : The data is descrialized from bit / byte format to the structure required by the reader.

HDFS stores the data in bit / bye blocks.

Spark Streaming:
1. scalable high throughput, fault-torerant stream processing of live data streams.
2. received lives input data and divides into small batches which are porcessed and returned as batches.
3. DStream - sequence of RDD
4. Currently support scala and Java
5. Basic python support avialable in Spark 1.2

Receives data from : kafka, flume, HDFS/S3 Kiness, Twitter
Pushes Data to : HDFS, Databases, Dashboard

Internal:
The input stream (DStream) goes into spark streaming.
Breaks up into batches.
feeds into the spark engine processing.
Generate the final results in streams of batches.
Silicing windows operations: 
	-window computations
		- window length
		- bliding interval
		- reduceByKeyAndWindow
